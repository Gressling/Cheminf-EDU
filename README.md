# Cheminf-EDU

ChemINF-EDU is a educational cheminformatics system designed to support a wide range of chemical data management tasks. It combines powerful user interfaces with robust RESTful APIs to provide seamless integration across various modules.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Standalone Executable (Recommended)

**Ready-to-run executable - No Python installation required!**

1. **Download** or build the executable (see [Building](#-building-standalone-executable) section)
2. **Run** the launcher: `launch.bat`
3. **Open** your browser to: **http://localhost:8050**

### Option 2: Python Development Setup

**For developers or customization:**

1. **Setup** (first time only):
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate it (Windows PowerShell)
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   
   # Install dependencies  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run** the application:
   ```bash
   # Easy launcher (recommended)
   python scripts/run.py
   
   # Or use platform launchers
   .\scripts\run.ps1        # PowerShell
   scripts\run.bat          # Command Prompt  
   ```

3. **Open** your browser to: **http://localhost:8050**

## 📋 Modules

This platform offers the following modules:

* **Molecules**: Manage and view detailed information about chemical molecules with SMILES data
* **Inventory**: Track and manage chemical inventory data including amounts and storage details
* **Projects Maintenance**: Organize and monitor projects related to chemical research and analysis
* **Tasks Maintenance**: Manage individual tasks and workflows within larger projects
* **Reactions Maintenance**: Define, view, and update chemical reaction data and kinetics
* **Reaction Participants Maintenance**: Oversee reaction components including reactants, products, and catalysts with their respective stoichiometric details
* **Reaction Overview**: Generate comprehensive overviews and chemical equations from aggregated reaction data
* **REST API**: Leverage a suite of RESTful endpoints for easy integration, automation, and data sharing across various applications

## 🗄️ Database

**SQLite Database** (Zero Configuration Required):
- **Location**: `cheminf_edu.db` (automatically created)
- **Tables**: 9 tables with sample chemistry data
- **Data**: 40 molecules, reactions, inventory, experiments, and more
- **Backup**: Simply copy the `.db` file

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

```bash
# Start specific modules
python scripts/run.py --module molecules
python scripts/run.py --module reactions
python scripts/run.py --module inventory

# Database operations  
python scripts/run.py --test-db      # Test database
python scripts/run.py --init-db      # Initialize database

# Get help
python scripts/run.py --help
```

## 🏗️ Building Standalone Executable

**Create a standalone Windows executable:**

```bash
# Build the executable
distribution\build_tools\build.bat

# Run the built executable
launch.bat
```

**Distribution Structure:**
```
distribution/
├── ChemINF-EDU.exe          # Self-contained executable (~200-300MB)
├── build_tools/             # Build scripts and configuration
└── docs/                    # Build documentation
```
